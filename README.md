### Data

- IMD has 2.5x2.5 temperature from June 2015 to now, which is about 9 years. Is that enough to draw meaningful inferences? It definitely isn't for climate, but maybe for weather?
- IMD has 1x1 temperature from 1951 but only until 2018 i think? Does it have data up to 2024 or would it be possible to aggregate the 2.5x2.5 up?

- 99acres seem fairly scrapeable, what about other broker websites
- Would it be possible to get circle rates for every state from government websites?

- Satellite images?

### Lit Review

- Seems to be plenty about using IMD data
- Seems to be plenty about heatwave prediction
- Look for Markov modelling literature
- Looking for land price forecasting literature
- Look for satellite image inference literature

### Ideas

- Markov chains for weather prediction
- Pricing model where loss function is modified by some sort of climate risk factor
